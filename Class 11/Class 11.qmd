Here we analyze our AlphaFold structure prediction models The input directory/folder comes from the ColabFold server: RBP4_0afab.result.zip

To visualize my model PDB files, Mol* was used:

![Superposed Model of PDB Structure Colored by pLDDT Scores](RBP4.png)

```{r}
results_dir <- "RBP4_0afab"
results_dir
```

```{r}
# File names for all PDB models
pdb_files <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                        pattern=".pdb",
                        full.names = TRUE)

# Print our PDB file names
basename(pdb_files)
```
I will use the Bio3D package for analysis 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

# Read all data from Models 
#  and superpose/fit coords
pdbs <- pdbaln(pdb_files, fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

A quick view of these model sequences:
```{r}
pdbs
```

## A Quick PCA
```{r}
pc.rbp<-pca(pdbs)
pc.rbp
```

```{r}
plot(pc.rbp)
```

## RMSD Analysis 
RMSD is a common measure of structural distance used in structural biology 

```{r}
rd <- rmsd(pdbs, fit=T)
range(rd)
```

```{r}
library(pheatmap)

colnames(rd) <- paste0("m",1:5)
rownames(rd) <- paste0("m",1:5)
pheatmap(rd)
```

```{r}

```

Here we run through a complete "pipeline" of structure analysis that begins with a single sequence identifier and ends in a PCA analysis.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

## Step 1. Retrieve a sequence for the protein we are interested in. We will take ADK "1ake_A"
```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

## Step 2. Run a BLAST search of the PDB for all related sequences to our input `aa`
```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

## Step 3. Download all structures. 
These are our "top hits" (i.e. all the structures in the PDB database related to our input sequence)
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## Step 4. Align and Sequence 

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

## Step 5. PCA
Let's use PCA to make sense of these confusing, complicated structure relationships
```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)

```


Let's make a trajectory (or movie) of the main conformational changes captured by PC1. We will use the `mktrj()` function for this...

```{r}
mktrj(pc, file="pca-result.pdb")
```

Back of the envelope comparison of the PDB size to UniProt

```{r}
uniprot <- 253206171
pdb <- 231029
pdb/uniprot*100
```
